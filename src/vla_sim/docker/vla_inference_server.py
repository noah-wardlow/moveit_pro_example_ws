"""LeRobot inference server for MoveIt Pro's ExecutePolicy.

Serves POST /infer and GET /health over HTTP. Runs in its own container (see
Dockerfile.vla_inference_server and the workspace docker-compose.yaml
`inference_server` service) so torch/lerobot stay out of the MoveIt Pro
images; the in-config adapter node (script/get_action_chunk_adapter.py)
bridges the /get_action_chunk ROS service to this server.

/infer requires the deployment's shared MOVEIT_FRONTEND_KEY as an
`Authorization: Bearer` token, the same key the MoveIt Pro web backend
endpoints use; a blank or unset key parks the server in the error state (fail
closed, matching those endpoints). /health stays token-free for health
probes. For a bare development run, export the documented dev key first
(`MOVEIT_FRONTEND_KEY=moveit-secret-key`).

The socket binds before the checkpoint loads: /health reports
loading|ready|error and /infer answers 503 (loading) or 500 (load failed) with
the same detail until the model is ready, so the adapter can tell the operator
exactly what is wrong from the MoveIt Pro UI. A bad or missing checkpoint
parks the server in the error state, surfacing the problem through the
service instead of exiting into a compose restart loop.

Each knob resolves as: an explicit CLI flag > the per-config model-serving
YAML (vla_serving.yaml, default /vla_config/vla_serving.yaml, mounted from
src/vla_sim/config/) > a built-in default. A missing or empty YAML file is
fine, so a bare `python vla_inference_server.py --checkpoint <dir-or-hf-id>`
still works for development; a malformed file or value parks the server in
the error state.
